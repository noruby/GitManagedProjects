\section{Introduction}
Mid-infrared plasmonics based on metal materials is beneficial for a number of applications including surface-enhanced spectroscopies\cite{Osawa}\cite{Neubrech}, plasmonic circuit\cite{Ebbesen}, chemical sensors\cite{Matthew}, thermal radiation control\cite{Takahara}, and strong field effect\cite{Kusa2015}. 
Their efficiencies and functionalities rely on the degree of electric-field enhancement induced by surface plasmons (SPs), namely, localized surface plasmons (LSPs) and surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs).

The electric-field enhancement is limited by damping or decay rate of the SPs, which comes from either radiative or irradiative damping of the SPs. 
The radiative damping is regarded as coupling with propagating light, that highly depends on the detail of metal shape and size, or the applications. On the other hand, the irradiative damping originates from electron-electron scattering or electron-lattice scattering, which is inherently inevitable for the plasmonic applications. Here, metal morphology is known to be influential for the irradiative loss, which is expressed by its dielectric constant\cite{Jens}\cite{Hunghua}.

Gold is often used for a plasmonic material in visible and mid-infrared range due to its high optical conductivity and stability under ambient condition. Propagation length of SPPs essentially characterized the irradiative damping. 
However, the propagation length of mid-infrared SPPs on gold has not been measured to our knowledge, whereas Shiba {\it et al.} reported on copper\cite{Shiba}.

In this study, we quantitatively investigated the propagation length of mid-infrared SPPs bound to a Au/air interface, by using several sets of a waveguide with different lengths at a wavelength of $10.6\:\mathrm{\mu m}$. 
During the experiment, morphology of the gold waveguide was manipulated by thermal annealing, and measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). 

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: 
In Sec. \ref{sec:device}, design and fabrication of the device are illustrated.
In Sec. \ref{sec:experiment}, optical experiments and annealing procedure are introduced.
In Sec. \ref{sec:result}, the propagation length of SPPs and the characterized surface morphology are shown.
In Sec. \ref{sec:discussion}, we discuss the relation between the propagation length and the morphology of the sample.
In Sec. \ref{sec:conclusion}, we draw conclusions from the results of this research.

\section{Device design and fabrication}
\label{sec:device}
SPPs can be coupled with propagating light by using a grating structure which satisfies the phase-matching condition, as summarized by \cite{Koev},
\begin{equation}
k_{\mathrm{SPPgr}}=k_0 \sin \theta + \frac{2n\pi}{d},
\label{eq:phase-match}
\end{equation}
where $k_{\mathrm{SPPgr}}$ and $k_0=2\pi/\lambda_0$ is the wave vector of SPPs on the grating and propagating light, $\lambda_0$ is the wavelength of the propagating light, $\theta$ is an incident angle, $d$ is a grating pitch, and $n$ is a positive or negative integer. 

In this study, SPPs were excited by incident light with a grating (input coupler) to propagate along a waveguide until they reach another grating (output coupler) to radiate, as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:Device}(a). As the length of the SPP waveguide increases, the output power collected from the output coupler decreases at the same rate to the SPP power that flow into the output coupler. By using several sets of a waveguide with different lengths, we calculated the distance that the output power falls to $1/e$: that is, equivalent to the propagation length of the SPPs. We assume that the efficiency of SPP-light coupling is stable among all gratings, and maintained the incident light in power during the experiment. 

The SPP waveguide is terminated by the input and output couplers, and fabricated on a gold base layer on a glass substrate.
Fig. \ref{fig:Device}(c) shows the design of the waveguide and input/output couplers. The waveguides has a width of $0.5\:\mathrm{mm}$ and varied lengths of $3,5,7,9,11\:\mathrm{mm}$. The input coupler and output coupler of 1-mm lengths have widths of $0.5\:\mathrm{mm}$ and $1.5\:\mathrm{mm}$, respectively. Both of the input/output couplers have rectangular profiles with a grating pitch of $15\:\mathrm{\mu m}$ with a duty cycle of 50\%. The waveguide and swelling part of grating are set to be $0.8\:\mathrm{\mu m}$ higher than the gold base layer, because of the following reasons.

Grating height is reported to be significantly influential for the SPP-light coupling efficiency\cite{Koev}\cite{Justin}. 
To estimate the optimized grating height for the strongest SPP-light coupling, we conducted a numerical simulation on the reflection efficiency of a Au-coated grating, based on rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA)\cite{Leveque}. 
Here, we assume a grating with a rectangular profile with a grating pitch of $15\:\mathrm{\mu m}$ and a duty cycle of 50\%, the dielectric constant of polycrystalline gold for a grating material, and incident light as a plane wave propagating in vacuum at a wavelength of $10.6\:\mathrm{\mu m}$.
Fig. \ref{fig:Device}(b) shows clear dips on the reflection efficiency at the grating height of $0.2-1.3\:\mathrm{\mu m}$.
The dips originate from energy conversion from propagating light to SPPs.
From the numerical results and the beam divergence of the incident light, we expected that efficient coupling would be obtained for the height of $\sim0.8\:\mathrm{\mu m}$. This expectation is consistent with a previous report estimating optimum grating height for a rectangular grating to be 10\%-15\% of the wavelength in mid-infrared range\cite{Justin}.

The device was fabricated by means of electron beam lithography, thermal evaporation, and lift-off process. The gold base layer with a thickness of $200\:\mathrm{nm}$ was thermally evaporated on a glass substrate with a 5-nm-thick chromium adhesion layer, after the substrate was cleaned with acetone and ethanol. Then, EB resist (OEBR-CAP112PM, Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Co., Ltd) was spin-coated on the base layer with a thickness of $1700\:\mathrm{nm}$ to be exposed by electron beam and developed. Finally, gold with a thickness of $800\:\mathrm{nm}$ was evaporated on the top of the developed resist, and the resist was lifted off by using acetone. The whole fabrication process was conducted at room temperature. During the evaporation, we maintained the evaporation rate of gold to be $0.4\:\mathrm{nm/s}$, and the pressure inside the vacuum chamber to be less than $3\times10^{-5}\:\mathrm{Torr}$.

\section{Experiment}
\label{sec:experiment}
Figure \ref{fig:Experiment} shows the schematic of our experimental setup. 
A $\mathrm{CO_2}$ laser was used as a mid-infrared light source generating linearly polarized light at a wavelength of $15\:\mathrm{\mu m}$. 
The device was attached to a rotational and xyz-translational stage. 
P-polarized light was incident onto the input coupler at a certain angle that fulfills Eq. \ref{eq:phase-match} where $n=1$, being loosely collimated by a spherical mirror with a radius of curvature $R=400\:\mathrm{mm}$. 
The output light was collected by a power meter using a spherical mirror with $R=150\:\mathrm{mm}$. 
An aperture was placed in front of the power meter at the conjugate point of the output coupler. 
The time averaged power of the $\mathrm{CO_2}$ laser was controlled by the duty ratio of the power modulation in radio frequency.
The input power to the input coupler was typically $60\:\mathrm{mW}$, and the duty ratio was typically $0.5$.
We also used a He-Ne laser as a guide laser to be collinearly overlapped with the mid-infrared light. 

In order to modify the morphology of the Au film, the sample was annealed twice with a hotplate in Argon atmosphere\cite{Nogues}.
In the first annealing process, the sample was heated at $600\:^\circ\mathrm{C}$ for $20\:\mathrm{min}$, and gradually cooled on the hotplate to room temperature. In the second annealing, the sample was heated at $700\:^\circ\mathrm{C}$ for $16\:\mathrm{min}$, and cooled down in the same way.

Surface morphology was measured by AFM in non-contact mode, and crystal grains were identified by analyzing the height data of the surface based on the watershed algorithm\cite{Petr}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:result}
Figure \ref{fig:propagation_length} shows the measured output power as a function of the SPP waveguide length $L$ for (a) the as-grown, (b) once-annealed ($600\:^\circ\mathrm{C}$), and (c) twice-annealed ($600\:^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and $700\:^\circ\mathrm{C}$) sample.
Here, each trace ($a\!\sim\!c$) of the output power is normalized by the value at $L=0$, obtained by the least squares fitting with the exponential decay function $\exp(-L/L_{\mathrm{SPP}})$. 
The propagation length $L_{\mathrm{SPP}}$ is evaluated as $9.0\pm0.3\:\mathrm{mm}$, $12.0\pm0.4\:\mathrm{mm}$, and $14.7\pm0.7\:\mathrm{mm}$ for the sample (a), (b), and (c), respectively.
In this way, the propagation length increased by the annealing process.

The SPP-light coupling efficiency of the grating is estimated to be 18\% in the experiment, by calculating a square root of the normalized output power at $L=0$ divided by the input power.
After annealing, optimum incident angle for the maximum excitation efficiency of SPP was shifted by about $0.5^\circ$, but no significant change was confirmed in the value of the efficiency.

Figure \ref{fig:morphology} shows AFM topography images of the surface of SPP waveguides for the sample (a), (b), and (c).
Isotropic deposition of gold and flat surface were confirmed for all samples. 

Surface roughness is estimated to be $5.67\:\mathrm{nm}$, $2.82\:\mathrm{nm}$, and $2.15\:\mathrm{nm}$ for the sample (a), (b), and (c), by calculating two-dimensional root mean squares of deviations in height data. 
The surface roughness decreased by the annealing process.

For detailed characterization of the surface morphology, crystal grains were identified based on the watershed algorithm. Aspect ratio of the grain is calculated as $1.6\pm0.8$, $2.4\pm2.5$, and $2.0\pm1.8$ for the sample (a), (b), and (c), respectively. In the assumption that the grains are close to spherical shape, grain diameter is estimated to be $70\:\mathrm{nm}$, $190\:\mathrm{nm}$, and $180\:\mathrm{nm}$, for the sample (a), (b), and (c), respectively.
In this way, the crystal grain size significantly increased by the first annealing at $600\:^\circ\mathrm{C}$, and remained similar by the second annealing at $700\:^\circ\mathrm{C}$.

The grating structures were not significantly deformed after the annealing. However, pinholes with diameters of $0.3-1.2\:\mathrm{\mu m}$ appeared with a number density of $0.16\:\mathrm{\mu m^{-2}}$ after the first annealing process, and increased to $0.44\:\mathrm{\mu m^{-2}}$ in number density after the second annealing.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
Propagation length of SPP $L_{\mathrm{SPP}}$ at Au/air boundary can be calculated by the following equation,
\begin{equation}
 L_{\mathrm{SPP}} = \frac{1}{2\:\mathrm{Im} k_{\mathrm{SPP}}},
\label{eq:propagation_length}
 \end{equation}
where the wave vector is $k_{SPP}=\lambda/(2\pi\sqrt{\epsilon_g/(\epsilon_g+1)})$, and $\epsilon_g=\epsilon'_g+i\epsilon''_g$ is relative dielectric constants of gold. 
By substituting the dielectric constant of polycrystalline gold\cite{Palik} into Eqn. \ref{eq:propagation_length}, the propagation length of SPP is calculated to be $12.3\:\mathrm{mm}$ at a wavelength of $10.6\:\mathrm{\mu m}$.
Our experimentally measured values of  $9.0\pm0.3\:\mathrm{mm}$, $12.0\pm0.4\:\mathrm{mm}$, and $14.7\pm0.7\:\mathrm{mm}$ agree with the theoretical estimation of $12.3\:\mathrm{mm}$, confirming that SPPs at Au/air interface do propagate for along distance of $>10\:\mathrm{mm}$.

Grain boundaries reduce the mean free path of electrons\cite{Jens}. Therefore, the SPPs loss its energy by introduction of the grain boundaries due to the oscillating electrons, decreasing the propagation length. 
An additional loss mechanism was suggested in \cite{Kuttge}, that SPPs scatter due to inhomogeneities of free electron gas due to grain boundaries. 

Comparing the first annealing at $600\:^\circ\mathrm{C}$ , we find enlargement of the crystal grains, suppression of the surface roughness, and the increased propagation length. Since influence of the grain boundaries become stronger as the averaged grain diameter decreases, we confirmed the longer propagation length of the mid-infrared SPPs in mid-infrared range which is contributed from enlargement of crystal grains.

After the second annealing at $700\:^\circ\mathrm{C}$, although the propagation length increased considerably, the averaged grain diameter does not enlarged, comparing the once-annealed sample and the twice annealed sample. 
This mismatch occurred can be attributed to the reduced aspect ratio of the crystal grains and the deviation. As the aspect ratio decrease, the area of grain boundaries get smaller even if the estimated grain diameter was unchanged. It follows that, averaged number of grain boundaries that the SPPs passing through per a unit length increases, and the mean free path of electron decreases. The reduced deviation results similarly to the area of grain boundaris, thus influences the mean free path of electrons.
In any case, the elongated propagation length was demonstrated by the annealing, which is relevant with the material morphology.

Thermal annealing is convenient method for controlling material morphology\cite{Nogues}. Its minor side effects are that pinholes were generated on the surface of waveguides by the annealing. However, the propagation length increased by the annealing, and the the size of the pinhole is much smaller than the wavelength of the mid-infrared SPPs. Therefore we conclude that the decrease of the propagation length due to the pinholes is less than the increase of the propagation length due to the morphology change. 
Moreover, the optimum incident angle onto the gratings was shifted by about $0.5^\circ$. This angle shift is supposed to be slightly different for each of the gratings, resulting in the increased relative error for the measured propagation length.

As presented above, we showed that SPPs at Au/air interface propagates as long as $>10\mathrm{mm}$ at the mid-infrared wavelength of $10.6\:\mathrm{\mu m}$.
We also demonstrated that the SPP propagation length increase by thermal annealing, which increases the crystal grain size and suppresses the surface roughness.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We measured the propagation length of SPPs on polycrystalline gold in mid-infrared range, for the first time to the best of our knowledge. 
The measured propagation length is in good agreement with an estimation by the dielectric constant of polycrystalline gold.
We also demonstrated that thermal annealing increases the grain size, suppress the surface roughness, and increases the SPP propagating length. 
Such quantitative evaluation of the irradiative loss of SPP is beneficial for deeper understandings and applications of mid-infrared plasmonics.
