abstract = {We present a simplified analytic formula that may be used to design gratings intended to couple long-wave infrared radiation to surface plasmons. It is based on the theory of Hessel and Oliner (1965). The recipe is semiempirical, in that it requires knowledge of a surface-impedance modulation amplitude, which is found here as a function of the grating groove depth and the wavelength for silver lamellar gratings at CO2 laser wavelengths. The optimum groove depth for photon-to-surface-plasmon energy conversion was found by experiment and calculation to be $\sim$10\%--15\% of the wavelength. This value is about twice what has been reported previously in the visible spectral range for sinusoidal grating profiles.},

The procedure involves thin gold film evaporation onto freshly cleaved mica substrates, followed by 1 min annealing at 650 °C under nitrogen. The annealed gold surfaces are compared to those of freshly evaporated gold films on mica using cyclic voltammetry and atomic force microscopy. Our results favorably compare to other published annealing techniques, with minimal equipment and time necessary to reproducibly obtain atomically flat gold terraces. "

We examine some of the consequences of these length scales for exploiting surface plasmon-polariton modes as a means to provide sub-wavelength optics. The four length scales discussed are the SPP wavelength, the SPP propagation distance, and the penetration depths of the field associated with the SPP into the dielectric and metal media that bound the interface that supports the SPP. Length scales spanning seven orders of magnitude, from nanometres to centimetres, are of relevance to SPPs. This paper concludes by identifying some of the challenges that lie ahead.}

It is shown that the upper boundaries of these films contain grains forming a faceted structure. This faceted structure is quantitatively described by the four statistical quantities: root mean square values of the heights of the irregularities, power spectral density function (PSDF), diagram describing the distribution of the directions of the normals to the boundaries and one-dimensional distribution of the heights of the irregularities. The grain structure is quantitatively described by two quantities: mean grain size and grain size distribution.}

                  The field of plasmonics has the potential to enable unique applications in the mid-infrared (IR) wavelength range. However, as is the case regardless of wavelength, the choice of plasmonic material has significant implications for the ultimate utility of any plasmonic device or structure. In this manuscript, we review the wide range of available plasmonic and phononic materials for mid-IR wavelengths, looking in particular at transition metal nitrides, transparent conducting oxides, silicides, doped semiconductors, and even newer plasmonic materials such as graphene. We also include in our survey materials with strong mid-IR phonon resonances, such as GaN, GaP, SiC, and the perovskite SrTiO3, all of which can support plasmon-like modes over limited wavelength ranges. We will discuss the suitability of each of these plasmonic and phononic materials, as well as the more traditional noble metals for a range of structures and applications and will discuss the potential and limitations of alternative plasmonic materials at these IR wavelengths.},

abstract="We report the design, fabrication, and characterization of a periodic grating of shallow rectangular grooves in a metallic film with the goal of maximizing the coupling efficiency of an extended plane wave (PW) of visible or near-infrared light into a single surface plasmon polariton (SPP) mode on a flat metal surface. A PW-to-SPP power conversion factor >45{\%} is demonstrated at a wavelength of 780 nm, which exceeds by an order of magnitude the experimental performance of SPP grating couplers reported to date at any wavelength. Conversion efficiency is maximized by matching the dissipative SPP losses along the grating surface to the local coupling strength. This critical coupling condition is experimentally achieved by tailoring the groove depth and width using a focused ion beam.",
